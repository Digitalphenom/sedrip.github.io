              <h1>How I Made 40k Selling Graphic T-shirts Online</h1>

            four years ago I was in a tough spot, I hated my boring low paying job and my boss wasn't the nicest guy to work with. So I decided to take things into my own hands and started a home business selling printed t-shirts online. Once I acquired the proper printing set-up, it quickly became my Money Making Printing System. This system has been my bread and butter for the last four years. I was able to make close to Forty Thousand Dollars In Only My Second Year in business, selling graphic T-shirts on eBay alone. My initial investment was a mere three thousand dollars and tons effort.</p>
            
            <p>You can have the same Money Making Printing System for a fraction of that price, by purchasing it from me. With the right set-up, and know how (don't worry Ill show you how to do it faster) You’ll be right on your way to running your own at home Money Making Printing System and easily making the same amount of money, and if your persistent enough, exceeding that figure easily.</p>
            
            <h2>Testing Market Method Explained</h2>
            
            <p>Here's the simple strategy I used to sell over <em>Forty Thousand Dollars</em> worth of shirts in only my first two years of business.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Look for popular designs, trends etc. (Tee spy is awesome for this)</li>
            <li>Find proven winners (look at sales history)</li>
            <li>Replicate or reiterate designs.</li>
            <li>Upload your designs to your merchant account.</li>
            </ol>
             <p> Then simply wait for orders to come in, It's that easy. I sold over 5000 shirts using this same method. Check pictures for proof. Heres a <a href="https://www.ebay.com/usr/caliinkedtees" target="_blank">link</a> to my eBay account. I closed down my shop a couple months ago so I no longer have anything listed, but you can verify the feedback using this <a href="https://www.ebay.com/usr/caliinkedtees"target="_blank">link</a></p>
            
            
            <p><em>Once you have a solid system for generating sales all you need is a way to fulfill all those orders you will be getting.</em></p>
            
            
            <h2>Here's A Break Down Of The Money Making Printing System:</h2>
            <ul>
            <p><strong><li>George Knight 16x20 Heat-Press- Retail- $1600</li></strong>
            This will be your workhorse. It’s built like a tank and made by one of the best heat-press manufactures. It never failed me and was always reliable. The heating mechanism is in excellent condition, heats up to 500 degrees - but you’ll never need that much heat- most graphics transfer at around 340-395. It comes with excellent support. They also carry a large supply of replacement and maintenance parts. You can visit their site <a href= "https://www.heatpress.com/support.php" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>
            
            
            <p><strong><li>GCC Expert II 24 LX Vinyl Cutter Plotter Contour Cutting- Retail $749</li></strong>
            I added this to my work flow two years ago. It enabled me to scoop up small custom print jobs that everyone will ask you about once they know you "do shirts." It’s also a great tool for experimenting with new designs without having to commit to a print run. The market is flooded with novel ideas for you to cash in on. When you use my (testing market method) you’ll bulk up your online store with plenty of designs for your customers to choose from, leaving you with a steady flow of orders to fulfill and plenty of cash in your pocket!</p>
            
            <p><strong><li>Digital Knight 6x8 Label Press- Retail $695</li></strong>
            This sturdy 6x8 label press made by George Knight- allows you to re-label generic shirts with your own brand. A great method for increasing the appeal of your product, increase sales, and also differentiates from the competition.</p>
            
            <p><strong><li>Zebra ZP450 CTP Thermal Label Printer- Retail $120</strong>
            Quickly print thousands of labels at the click of a button, and then easily stick them onto your package to ship, more efficient than manually cutting and taping labels and a huge time saver too.</p>
            
            <p><strong><li>Two Screens and a One Color Table Press- make transfers or print on stock- Retail-$100</li></strong>
            Simply burn your Image onto the screen then make a print of 20-30 transfers. This will lower your total cost and give you the $13-$18 profit per shirt.</p> <p>Keep in mind you will need a heating element to cure your transfers if you decide to go this route. Although you can use a heat-press, a conveyor dryer is recommended.<strong> If you don't have access to one</strong>, you can rent out a print station at <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/grow-your-own-media-los-angeles" target="_blank">GYO</a> media in Glendale CA for $10 bucks an hour, or purchase a mini dryer. I recommend a little buddy or <a href="https://www.screenprinting.com/products/vastex-d-100-conveyor-dryer-16-x-16-120v?variant=17496819597423&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=shopping&gclid=CjwKCAiAnfjyBRBxEiwA-EECLL9LWwDNacYgmmNAJshxPBV2VMn_HMtDDabrYAKGPcKVQSGuZqsf4BoCelUQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">Vastex D-100 </a>if your just starting out.

            <h2>Here's Your Opportunity</h2>
            
            Now you’re probably asking what's this going to cost you, and why are you selling this money making system if you’re making money from of it? 
            
            <p>Look, I already made my money back 30 times over my initial investment in only a couple of years. Not only that, there's a feeling of accomplishment that comes when you follow through on what you set out to do. I'm now at a point where I’m moving on to other business ventures and would like to find someone who is in a similar situation I was in four years ago. Give them the opportunity to jump start their own<em> Money Making Printing System</em> at a fraction of the cost, and do it faster.</p>
            
            <p>If you haven't done so already, the total retail dollar value calculates to $3,264, and that's not including tax or the free stuff I’m including, but don't worry you won’t be paying anything close to that, and even if you were, that's pretty reasonable. When you know what you’re doing you can easily make 10-20-40 times your money back on your initial investment, as I did. But, that's not always the case. A lot of trial and error and times goes into starting a business along with the initial cash investment. Most people quit before they even get started. But not you, you’ll have a proven system ready to go, your trial and error and time wasted will be practically eliminated.</p>
            
            <p>This is why my offer to you is a no brainer and you should immediately jump at the chance and pick up your phone right now!</p>
            
            <p>If you’re smart, hungry and willing to take tons of action, but for whatever reason are strapped for cash. Here's your opportunity to leverage someone else's experience and buy an existing business set-up on the cheap. Finally, free yourself from your dreaded job, or simply make some extra cash on the side</p>
            
            <p>That’s why if you hit me up this week, and are committed to take action, and decide to follow through with my <em>Money Making Printing System</em>. I’ll let it all go for only $1900. Yep, that's right I’m practically giving it away. (I paid 1,436 for my heat press alone) But check this out. I’m not only including the equipment in the <em>Money Making Printing System</em>. I'll also throw in some extra goodies for you to get started for <strong>FREE</strong> <em>But ONLY</em> if you hit me up within the next week. (213) 444- call-text <em>Fabricio</em></p>
